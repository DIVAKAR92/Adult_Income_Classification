# Adult_Income_Classification

We use the Adult income data set, which we can get from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/

We first create some summary charts and tables to explore the data. This is followed by  fitting a classification model to the data. Here we are trying to predict whether an individual earns more or less than $50k. We present the classification error rate and the confusion matrix.  Then we fit several other classification models to the data and check their performance compared to the first model.
